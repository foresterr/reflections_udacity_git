What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository, Git creates its gitty stuff that it needs
	to track my commits later on (which is contained in the .git directory).
	And I need to do it because otherwise Git could not track my changes and
	would be useless.
	Actually, the above isn't clear. When I initialize a repository, Git creates
	the repository in my working directory. I need to do it to be actually able
	to make use of the repository.

What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is different from working directory because it can contain only
	some files, and from the repository because files there are still not
	commited. It's useful because it allows to separate current changes to the
	working directo
