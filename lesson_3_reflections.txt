When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my work or cooperate. But it could also serve as 
    a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because someone might have introduced some changes in the meantime that
    would not play nice with my current work, and then I would have to resolve
    merge conflicts whenever they crop up and not when I want to.
