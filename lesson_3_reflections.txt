When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my work or cooperate. But it could also serve as 
    a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because someone might have introduced some changes in the meantime that
    would not play nice with my current work, and then I would have to resolve
    merge conflicts whenever they crop up and not when I want to.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

    Clone is an exact copy of existing repository. Fork is similar, but on
    Github. Branches are like versions within same repository. I'd use clone to
    start a new project with the same base (or, to make a copy of a project that
    I have access to locally). Fork I'd use if I wanted to play with somebody's
    else project on Github (whether just for myself or to maybe contribute 
    later). And I would use branches to work within a single project (creating 
    new features, adding experimental changes, etc.)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

    I can access it offline, so I can have an idea how my changes will interact
    with the remote even if I can't access it at the moment.
